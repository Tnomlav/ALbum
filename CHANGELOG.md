# Album Changelog

This file records release-level changes. Each exported release should have:

1. A version entry in this file.
2. A Git commit whose message starts with the version, for example `v1.1.20:`.
3. An annotated Git tag with the same version, for example `v1.1.20`.
4. The APK SHA-256 and verification status recorded in the entry when an APK is exported.

## v1.1.21 - 2026-08-27

- Changed Move to use native MediaStore/SAF move operations where supported, avoiding duplicate copies and unnecessary source-delete confirmation.
- Made the Move/Copy destination page close immediately after confirmation while transfer work continues in the background.
- Improved non-media folder search with a persistent local index, background refresh, cache freshness window, and stale-task protection.
- Continued the recent archive, Pixiv tag, P-page reload, web access, editor control, player gesture, thumbnail, and selection-flow fixes.
- APK: `app/release/app-release.apk`
- SHA-256: `DB5B77CC0F7BD5B1A71745A5055F2C79D980A23429C674A6171CD25065007909`
- Signature: verified with APK Signature Scheme v2; 1 signer.

## v1.1.22 - 2026-08-27

- Removed archive-page scan results after a Pixiv archive move succeeds; copy operations keep their scan results.
- Removed archive records after manual Move completes, including SAF/MediaStore deletion confirmation paths.
- Reset the archive page to its initial state when all scan results have been cleared.
- Fixed batch archive cleanup so previously archived records are not removed accidentally.
- Included the recent duration alignment, editor carousel snapping, video dialog transparency, and decoded Chinese path display fixes.

- SHA-256: `4E14E6828B5021CB81522CB944D69FD11C3D2E4CE22C08AED2012B6875677674`

## v1.1.23 - 2026-08-27

- Made multi-select folder names use the same constrained ellipsis layout as the normal thumbnail view.
- Fixed Back in the Pixiv archive page to leave multi-select mode before closing the page.
- Improved global Move to discover persisted SAF source trees and prefer provider-native document moves, avoiding unintended copy behavior.
- APK: `app/release/app-release.apk`
- SHA-256: `4ED4C7A99A0F7A232D4564B1B9E41A69CD36DF9D7DB617F336F3686B6DCBFA5C`
